# Hi there 👋 I'm Alejandro

## 🚀 About Me
I'm Alejandro, a Computer Systems Engineering student passionate about technology, programming, and continuous learning. My journey into software development started in the most unexpected way: back in elementary school, we had a few classes where our teacher dictated HTML code, and we wrote it in Notepad to build a simple web page. At that time, I thought: *"What on earth is this?"* — without imagining that one day I would become a developer.

Since then, my curiosity has only grown. Today, I dedicate myself to becoming a better programmer day by day, learning from others, and striving to improve not only my technical skills but also my mindset as a builder and problem solver.

## 🌱 What I'm Focused On
- **Learning every day**: I believe programming is a craft that requires constant practice and exploration.
- **Becoming better step by step**: Improvement is not about giant leaps, but about consistent progress.
- **Learning from others**: Collaboration and shared knowledge are the keys to growth.
- **Building real-world solutions**: I enjoy turning ideas into working systems that solve problems.


## ✨ Personal Philosophy
Programming is more than writing code — it's about creating, learning, and evolving.  
I see myself as a lifelong learner who embraces challenges, values persistence, and believes that every bug fixed and every feature built is a step toward becoming a better developer.
